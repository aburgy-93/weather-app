-Still need to seperate the different views and their functionality.
-Currently everything runs in weatherView.js rather than it's own module.
-Need to set the View.js module to be able to render modules universally.
-weatherView will display the current weather
-forecastView will display the 3-day forecast
-hourlyView will display the 24hr forecast
